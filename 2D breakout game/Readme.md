# The Game:
It is a simple game where there is bricks on the top part of the play board and a ball that keep moving and bounce whenever it hits the top & sides of the playboard, the bricks or the player pad.  

the player is controlling a pad by directing it right and left to keep the ball from reaching the bottom side of the play board as this will be losing that ball and its a game-over. 

At the same time the player is trying to have to the ball hitting the bricks, and as the ball hit a brick, the brick disappears and the player is rewarded higher score. until no more bricks are left and then its the end of the game as the player wins.
