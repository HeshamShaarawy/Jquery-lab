# Snake Game

This game is based on the popular back in the days snake game that was on Nokia mobile phones.  
During the game, the player is directing a moving snake toward food items shown on the board, while trying to avoid having the snake going out of the play board or into itself.  As the snake eats food it grows longer and the score increments. Once the score reachs a goal score, the player can choose to go to next level where the snake moves faster which is more challenging.
